# 100Devs
This repository contains some of my lesser projects from 100Devs. These were some of my working versions of these projects. I enjoyed working on these and preparing myself for full-stack engineering. Leon is an amazing teacher and I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to learn full-stack web development follow and learn from him.
