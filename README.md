# 100Devs
This repository contains some of my lesser projects from 100Devs. These were some of my working versions of these projects. I enjoyed working on these and preparing myself for full-stack engineering. .

Leon is an amazing teacher and I would highly recommend that anyone who wants to learn full-stack web development follow and learn from him. Thanks Leon for allowing me to believe in myself and give myself the know-how. Without your teaching and guidance I don't know if I would ever have believed I could truly be a successful software engineer.
